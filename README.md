# New Relic Ansible Collection - newrelic.newrelic_agents

This repo contains the Ansible role for installing the [New Relic Java agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-java). Other roles will be added in the future.

## Installation

To install the collection, use the `ansible-galaxy` command:

```shell
$ ansible-galaxy collection install newrelic.newrelic_agents
```

## Example usage

The following examples are strictly for reference purposes, and are drawn from the individual roles' examples. See the [Java agent role repo](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent-ansible-role) for full documentation.

*Note: When using these roles from this collection, rather than directly, you must either add the `collections` keyword to your playbooks as shown below, or use the fully qualified collection name, for example `newrelic.newrelic_agents.newrelic_java_agent`.*

```yaml
---
- hosts: java_servers

  collections:
    - newrelic.newrelic_agents

  vars:
    nr_java_agent_config:
      license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
      # etc.
  
  include_role:
    name: newrelic_java_agent
```
